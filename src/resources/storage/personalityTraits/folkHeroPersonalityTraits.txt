I judge people by thier actions, not their words.
If someone is in trouble, I'm always ready to lend help.
When I set my mind to something, I follow through no matter what gets in my way.
I have a strong sense of fair play and always try to find the most equitable solutions to arguments.
I'm confident in my own abilites and do what I can to instill confidence in others.
Thinking is for other people, I prefer action.
I misuse long words in an attempt to sound smarter.
I get bored easily. When am I going to get on with my destiny?
