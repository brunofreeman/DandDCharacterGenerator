I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else is second.
The ship is most important - crewmates and captains come and go.
I'll always remember my first ship.
In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.
I was cheated out of my fair shore of the profits, and I want to get my due.
Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine.
